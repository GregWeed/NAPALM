# NAPALM
Network Analysis, Parsing and Logging Machine (NAPALM)
Author: weed12@live.marshall.edu


Napalm reads TCP Dumps that are exported from Wireshark and analyzes network traffic percentages,
FTP communication, ARP requests, and also provides an Ip address lookup to determine incoming traffic
from external ip's.  A GUI is provided requiring PyQt5 and Python3.6, as well as a terminal application if chosen
when running from the Terminal.
